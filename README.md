# Codewarriors_Assigment 3
Assignment 3 revolves around developing and testing a small application.

You will be provided with some initial requirement and design documentation describing a small application. You will also be provided with some interface files defining the domain objects. These will be available in the Assignment 2 directory of the Resources section of the subject's Interact site.

Your task is to develop and test the required classes to support a use case using a test driven development approach. Your development should take place within a version control system using appropriately sized, commented, and timely commits.

You must then identify and specify user acceptance tests for that use cases, and carry out and report onthose tests

Please note that the focus in this assignment is on the process and techniques applied, not the complexity of the code. It is recognised that the process applied is ‘way over the top’ for the size of problem addressed.

Also note that it is recognised that standard practice is to specify user acceptance tests before development activities occur. Unfortunately the semester timetable makes this impractical.
 

Tasks

1. Version Control (10%)

Establish an individual version control repository for the assignment. Follow version control best practice during your implementation and testing of the required code modules. All code should be under version control from the beginning of the assignment.

2.	Implement and Test Modules (Unit Testing) (40%)

Implement the modules required to support your chosen use case according to the provided design. Use a unit test framework to comprehensively test your implementations as you develop them. Use stubs, fake, or mock objects as appropriate to isolate the class under test.

Commit your code changes to the version control system with every new addition of functionality (method or class implementation)

2.	Integrate and Test Collaborations (Integration Testing) (30%)

Integrate your modules to support your chosen use case. Provide integration tests to check interaction between control, entity, and service classes without requiring GUI inputs.

Once again commit your code changes with every increment of functionality.

3. User Acceptance Tests (UAT). (20%)

On the basis of the requirement and design documentation identify some use case scenarios and test cases which can be used to check correct functionality in the implemented use case. Specify user acceptance test procedures, test data, and expected results for the most critical aspects of use case functionality. A template for a UAT will be available in the Assignment 1 directory of the Resources section of the subject's Interact site.

Commit your UAT specifications to version control.

Once the use case has been implemented, carry out the user acceptance tests you specified. Use the test data and procedures specified and check that it meets stated acceptance criteria. Report on the success or otherwise of the test.

Commit the completed test reports to your version control system.
